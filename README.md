## ⚠️ Challenges Faced & Solutions

This section documents real-world challenges encountered while building and deploying the Task Manager API, along with the solutions and architectural insights that shaped the final system.

### 1. Credential Resolution Failure in Local and CI Environments
- **Problem**: AWS SDK failed to initialize `DynamoDbClient` due to missing credentials.
- **Fix**: - Injected static credentials via test profile and configured `AwsConfig` to use `StaticCredentialsProvider` conditionally.
- **Insight**: Avoid relying on implicit credential chains. Explicit configuration improves portability and test reliability.

### 2. Region and Endpoint Configuration for LocalStack
- **Problem**: Integration tests failed due to missing or incorrect AWS region and endpoint.
- **Fix**: Used `@DynamicPropertySource` to inject LocalStack endpoint and region dynamically.
- **Insight**: Dynamic property injection ensures environment-specific configurations are isolated and testable.

### 3. Cold Start Performance in AWS Lambda
- **Problem**: Spring Boot’s startup time impacted Lambda responsiveness.
- **Fix**: Scoped bean loading, minimized dependencies, and explored lighter frameworks like Micronaut and Quarkus.
- **Insight**: Cold start latency affects UX and cost — optimize startup paths in serverless design.

### 4. Test Isolation and Environment Separation
- **Problem**: Mixing production and test configurations led to brittle tests.
- **Fix**: Created test-specific profiles and isolated AWS config using `LocalStackTestConfig`.
- **Insight**: Environment isolation is foundational for reliable testing and safe CI/CD pipelines.

### 5. DynamoDB GSI Query Design
- **Problem**: Querying tasks by status triggered full table scans.
- **Fix**: Added a GSI (`status-index`) and refactored queries to use `QueryRequest`.
- **Insight**: Indexing strategy in NoSQL systems directly impacts performance and cost.

### 6. Local Testing vs Cloud Behavior Drift
- **Problem**: Tests passed locally but failed in AWS due to emulation gaps.
- **Fix**: Added environment-specific test cases and documented LocalStack limitations.
- **Insight**: Validate critical paths in real cloud environments — emulation is powerful but imperfect.

### 7. Spring Boot Lambda Handler Configuration
- **Problem**: Lambda failed to invoke Spring Boot due to misconfigured handler.
- **Fix**: Used `FunctionInvoker::handleRequest` and verified wiring with minimal payloads.
- **Insight**: Framework integration with Lambda requires precise handler setup and lightweight bootstrapping.

### 8. CI/CD Pipeline Stability
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions intermittently failed due to Docker dependencies and timing issues.
- **Fix**: Added Docker service config, readiness checks, and isolated test profiles.
- **Insight**: CI/CD pipelines must be resilient to environment drift and dependency timing.

### 9. Handling Environment-Specific Configuration Without Hardcoding
- **Problem**: Config values leaked across environments, causing unpredictable behavior.
- **Fix**: Used `@ConfigurationProperties` and profile-specific bindings to isolate configs.
- **Insight**: Clean separation of environment configs is essential for portability and security.

### 10. Structured Logging for Observability
- **Problem**: Logs lacked context, making debugging difficult.
- **Fix**: Integrated SLF4J with MDC for structured, contextual logging.
- **Insight**: Observability isn’t just about logs — it’s about traceability and actionable insights.

### 11. Error Handling and Response Consistency
- **Problem**: API responses were inconsistent across failure scenarios.
- **Fix**: Centralized error handling with `@ControllerAdvice` and standardized error DTOs.
- **Insight**: Consistent error handling improves client trust and system resilience.

### 12. DTO vs Entity Separation
- **Problem**: Internal entity models were exposed directly through the API.
- **Fix**: Introduced DTOs and mappers to decouple persistence from API contracts.
- **Insight**: DTO separation is key for API evolution, security, and clean layering.

### 13. Lambda Timeout and Memory Constraints
- **Problem**: Complex operations exceeded Lambda’s default limits.
- **Fix**: Increased timeout/memory in SAM template and optimized queries.
- **Insight**: Serverless design requires tight control over resource usage — efficiency is a cost factor.

### 14. Documentation Drift and Technical Debt
- **Problem**: Evolving features outpaced documentation updates.
- **Fix**: Created a `docs/` folder, added diagrams, changelogs, and badges.
- **Insight**: Documentation is part of the system — version it, test it, and treat it as essential.
